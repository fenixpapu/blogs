# [Refine web searchs](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en)

- You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise..
    - Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
    - Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for `site:nytimes.com` will work, but `site: nytimes.com` won’t.
